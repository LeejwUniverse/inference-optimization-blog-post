# inference-optimization-blog-post

The code in this repo is in reference to my blog post on optimizing inference for Diffusion Policy. Much of the code is taken straight from the original Diffusion Policy repo (`https://github.com/real-stanford/diffusion_policy`)! Big thanks to Cheng Chi and the team at TRI/Columbia for releasing clean code that I could use for pedagogical purposes. The folders in this repo correspond to posts outlined on my website here (`https://personal-website-33da83.webflow.io/diffusion-inference-optimization`). 

Part 3 - Refer to `diffusion_policy_inference.py` for Pytorch profiling of the noise prediction U-Net & coarse grained `time.perf_counter()` profiling of the overall policy eval. 
Part 4 - Refer to ....
